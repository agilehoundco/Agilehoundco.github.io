##  About Me

Hello, I am Mari (Marie-Louise), I‚Äôm an Agile Project Manager, Scrum Master, and Agile Coach with 10+ years leading enterprise transformations across cloud, cybersecurity, healthcare, life sciences, and insurance. I turn complex programs into predictable delivery‚Äîremoving impediments, coaching collaboration, and building resilient, high-performing teams.

Most recently I worked in a Cybersecurity Division, for a large US company, and was the Coach/Scrum Master for network/cloud security teams, other deparments under the CISO and worked with vendors like Accenture and Wiz to deliver initiatives at scale. My sweet spot is bridging Agile concepts with security & cloud programs.

Recognized as a self-motivated servant leader, with strong Emotional Intelligence, Communication Skills, Time Management, and Interpersonal Skills, adept at guiding organizations and cross-functional software teams through Agile adoption and maturity using Scrum, Kanban, XP, and SAFe frameworks, with a proven ability to transition teams from Waterfall or ad hoc practices to predictable, efficient delivery
